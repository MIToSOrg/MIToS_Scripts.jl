  abstract: "MIToS is an environment for mutual information analysis and a framework
    for protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and protein structures (PDB) management
    in Julia language. It integrates sequence and structural information through SIFTS,
    making Pfam MSAs analysis straightforward. MIToS streamlines the implementation
    of any measure calculated from residue contingency tables and its optimization and
    testing in terms of protein contact prediction. As an example, we implemented and
    tested a BLOSUM62-based pseudo-count strategy in mutual information analysis.The
    software is totally implemented in Julia and supported for Linux, OS X and Windows.
    Itâ€™s freely available on GitHub under MIT license: http://mitos.leloir.org.ar. Supplementary
    data are available at Bioinformatics online."
